Homework 09 - MySQL
There are 2 files.  The Sakila.sql is for the Homework assignment, where the .ipy file is was trying the Sakila homework items with the Advanced SQL capabilities.
I did leave in some of the additional items and commented them out.  What is uncommented should be what needs to run for the assignment under each of the section headings.
